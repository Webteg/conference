<p align="justify">We are looking for students willing to take an opportunity for participating in CIBSE 2018 while also lending us a hand for
	running the conference in the smoothest possible way. We expect student volunteers to have a great time during the conference,
	take advantage of all the programmed activities, and to engage with leading individuals in the Ibero-American Software Engineering
	community. Also, the participation in the student volunteer program is a great way to meet students from all over the world.</p>
