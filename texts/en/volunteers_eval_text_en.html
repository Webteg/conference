	Selection will be based on merits and needs:
	<br>
	&bull;&nbsp;Merit-based positions are for students with papers accepted to be presented at the conference. 
	<br>
	&bull;&nbsp;Need-based positions are for students that wish to participate in CIBSE without an accepted paper: in this case the CV of the student as well as the recommendation letter from a Professor will be the decisive factors.
