    Bogota is located in the heart of Colombia and can be reached by air or car. The most convenient connection is to take a
    flight directly to “El Dorado” Airport. The airport provides multiple connections per day to/from many countries.

    Once in the airport, if you want to reach your hotel by taxi, please enquire about certificated/secure taxis in any of the
    Airport information points. In these points, you can also obtain information about how to take public transport: regular
    buses, known as "feeders" (alimentadores), transport users from the Airport to Portal “El Dorado”, where you can connect
    with Transmilenio, which is the bus-based public transportation system that serves Bogota. To get on the feeders, you
    do not pay money. Instead, to get on the Transmilenio buses you need to buy and charge a card, that you can reuse during
    your entire stay.
