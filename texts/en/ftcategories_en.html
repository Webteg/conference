	<li><strong>Technical Papers </strong>(not exceeding 14 pages): 
		Technical papers should describe innovative research in the topics of
		the Foundations tracks. Papers in this submission category should
		describe a novel contribution to the topics and should carefully
		support claims of novelty with citations to the relevant literature.
		Evaluation criteria: Technical papers are evaluated on the basis of
		originality, soundness, relevance, importance of contribution,
		strength of validation, quality of presentation and appropriate
		comparison to related work. Where a submission builds upon previous
		work of the author(s), the novelty of the new contribution must be
		described clearly with respect to the previous work. Technical papers
		need to discuss clearly how the results were validated.</li>
	<li><strong>(NEW!) Emerging Ideas Papers </strong> (not exceeding 8 pages): Emerging
		ideas papers describe new, non-conventional approaches on the topics
		of the Foundations tracks, that depart from standard practice. They
		are intended to describe well-defined research ideas that are at an
		early stage of investigation. Evaluation criteria: Emerging ideas
		papers will be assessed primarily on their level of originality and
		potential for impact on the field in terms of promoting innovative
		thinking. Hence, inadequacies in the state-of-the-art and the
		pertinence, correctness, and impact of the idea must be described
		clearly. While the idea that is described does not need to be fully
		validated, a presentation of preliminary results that provide initial
		insights into the feasibility and/or impact of the idea is expected.
		In case of paper acceptance, authors have to prepare a poster from the
		paper and present it in the Poster Session. The Poster Session
		separates itself from the Technical Papersâ€™ Sessions by allowing
		authors the ability to get immediate, personal feedback from
		conference attendees during the session as they present their work.
		Posters also provide conference attendees an opportunity to see new
		work in the field in a more relaxed setting.</li>
	<li><strong>(NEW!) Tools Papers </strong> (not exceeding 8 pages): These papers
		should describe tools that complement research papers from two
		different perspectives: (i) The tool has been used previously as part
		of a support pipeline (e.g., to collect data, evaluate results, etc.);
		(ii) The tool implements a previously proposed technique/approach. The
		submissions must fall under the topics of the Foundations tracks and
		include a short video (Max. 5 minutes) describing the main features of
		the presented tool. The link to the video should be included in the
		paper abstract. Note that commercial products cannot be accepted. The
		tool demo track is for promoting scientific contributions instead of
		promoting sales of a tool currently being commercialized. Authors of
		accepted tool demo papers will be invited to give a presentation and
		present the tool in the Hands-on session. Both presentation and
		hands-on will be scheduled within the program. Evaluation criteria: We
		look for papers that include: (i) Clear motivation for the tool; (ii)
		The software engineering task/challenges the tool aims to address;
		(iii) Discussion regarding similar tools; (iv) Description of the tool
		features, envisioned users, and usage scenarios; (v) Results of
		validation studies for the case of mature tools, or design of planned
		studies if the tool is an early prototype.</li>
