<p align="justify">This track is the evolution of the Experimental Software Engineering
Latin American Workshop, which started in 2003 in Brazil and next joined
CIbSE in 2012. ESELAW provides a stimulating forum at which researchers
and practitioners can present and discuss recent research results on a
wide range of topics related to acquiring evidence and doing
experimentation in Software Engineering. In addition, the track
encourages the exchange of ideas so as to understand the strengths and
weaknesses of software engineering technologies and methods from a
strong evidence based viewpoint, including different kinds of empirical
studies. Research on empirical/experimental methods and the design and
analysis of different types of primary or secondary studies in the field
of software engineering are also welcome.</p>
