	The main economic benefit is that CIbSE offers a grant of 100 USD to offset some of the costs of the event (e.g., hotels,
	travels, and food). It is up to students to choose how to invest the money. The rest of expenses (included registration
	fees) must be covered by the student and / or the University that he/she represents.

	Moreover, being a student volunteer is an excellent opportunity to meet, interact, and network with leading academic and
	industrial researchers and practitioners in the area of software engineering. Such interactions often help shape the
	research direction for many students. Being a student volunteer is also a great way to meet other students from all over
	the world that share your interest for software engineering and to offset some of the costs of the conference!
