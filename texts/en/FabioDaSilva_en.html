    <b>Abstract</b>
</h3>
<p align="justify">Case study is an empirical method used to investigate complex phenomena in the field. It is particularly useful when the
    phenomenon of interest cannot be separate from the context in which it occurs. There is an extensive literature on how
    to design and conduct case studies in software engineering as well as in many other fields. However, conducting full
    scale case studies in software companies has several practical challenges that are often not documented in the literature
    and can make the life of the researchers very hard.</p>
<p align="justify"> In this talk, I intend to share my experience over the last decades working with software companies and conducting field
    studies to understand and improve software practice. I will discuss challenges when working with companies before, during
    and after a field study, and talk about some lessons "from the trenches". My goal is to stimulate researchers to conduct
    more (qualitative) case studies by clarifying the role of this research method in building knowledge about software practice
    and also to give some advices on how to overcome the challenges in their development.</p>
