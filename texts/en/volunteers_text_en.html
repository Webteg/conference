The objective of this option is to offer financial aid to students who want to attend the conference<br><br>
The help consists of paying the registration fees. The rest of expenses (i.e., hotels, travel expenses) must be covered by the student and / or the University that he/she represents<br><br>
Candidates must apply either to a merit scholarship or a need-based scholarship:<br>
<ul>
    <li>
            By merit, it applies to students whose articles were accepted, we will review the quality of the articles and we will choose the best ones.
    </li>
    <li>
            By need, it applies to students who want to come as participants, evaluate the HV, the budget and the reference of a teacher.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>In both cases, to apply for the scholarship, students must fill out a form (TBD), attach a one-page HV, a teacher's reference letter and budget.</p>
