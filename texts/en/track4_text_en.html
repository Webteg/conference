  The industry presentations track at CIbSE looks to bring closer software
  engineering researchers and industry practitioners to exchange ideas,
  learn about each other's ideas, and foster colaboration.

  The industry track looks to highlight practices, problems, and solutions
  existing in the industry to generate a better understanding for academics
  about the current industrial mindset and future challenges. This, with the
  objective of fostering a close colaboration between the responsibles for the
  concepts and tools used in software development, and the practitioners using
  such tools in their everyday life, in order to build next generation practives
  for the entire industry.
