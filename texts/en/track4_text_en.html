  The industry track looks to highlight modern practices, problems, and solutions
  in the industry to generate a better understanding for academics
  about the current industrial mindset and future challenges. This, with the
  objective of fostering a close colaboration between the responsibles for the
  concepts and tools used in software development, and the practitioners using
  such tools in their everyday life. This way we can build the next generation
  of practices and tools together!
