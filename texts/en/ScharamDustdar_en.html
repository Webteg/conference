    <p align="justify">
        In this talk I will explore research challenges ahead of us on how to integrate the Internet of Things (IoT) with software,
        people, and processes, considering modern Edge-, Cloud Computing and IoT technologies. I will present a fresh look
        at this problem, and examine how to integrate people, software services, and things with their data, into one novel
        resilient ecosystem, which can be modeled, programmed, and deployed on a large scale in an elastic way. This novel
        paradigm has major consequences on how we view, build, design, and deploy ultra-large scale distributed systems and
        establishes a novel foundation for “architecure of value” driven resilient ecosystems.
