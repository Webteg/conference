This track is the evolution of the Workshop on Requirements Engineering. This workshop 
started as a meeting of the Ibero-American requirements engineering community, but over 
the years has attracted attention from researchers from other parts of the world as well. 
WER is now an integral part of CIbSE as a whole.
