	<span class="tutValue">Associate professor of the Engineering School at Universidad de los Andes. Marcela HernÃ¡ndez Hoyos was born in BogotÃ¡, Colombia. She received her undergraduate degree in 1993 and her MS degree in 1996 in Computer Science Engineering, from the Universidad de Los Andes (BogotÃ¡). In 1998 she obtained a MS degree in Biomedical Engineering from the Center for Research and Applications in Image and Signal Processing (CREATIS Lab.) at the National Institute for Applied Sciences (INSA) of Lyon, France. She subsequently carried out research on vascular image processing at the same institution under an industrial grant. In 2002 she obtained her PhD degree with honors. The main result of her PhD work is the MARACAS (MAgnetic Resonance Angiography Computer Assisted AnalysiS) software, which won the first prix Siemens in the InforMag event of the â€œJournÃ©es FranÃ§aises de Radiologieâ€� 2000 (Paris). After graduation, she was involved in a project, purpose of which was to transfer MARACAS software to the industry. Since 2004 she has been involved in teaching and research activities. Presently, she is working as associate professor at the Computer Science Engineering Department of the Universidad de Los Andes. Her main research interest is in medical image processing with particular emphasis in vascular pathologies.</span>
