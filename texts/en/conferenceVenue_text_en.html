                        Universidad de los Andes was founded in 1948, and it was the first private university in Colombia that was independent from
                        political or religious movements or parties. It was conceived as a study center, a research center, and a place where
                        truth could be upheld. Ever since the university was founded, its activities have focused on excellence. Universidad
                        de los Andes was ranked eighth by the QS University Rankings 2015/2016 in Latin America, and it occupied the 283rd spot
                        globally. Moreover, the Faculty of Management has the prestigious “Triple Crown”, which consists of three accreditations
                        (EQUIS, AMBA, and AACSB); this is only held by 1% of business schools around the world. Additionally, eight undergraduate
                        programs in the Faculty of Engineering have the International ABET accreditation.
