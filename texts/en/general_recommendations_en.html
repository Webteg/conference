    Dear CIbSE’18 attendee,
</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">
    We have one more week to go before CIbSE'18-Bogota starts.
</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">
    The purpose of this message is to give you some general recommendations regarding your attendance to CIbSE 2018:
</p>
<ol start="1" style="font-size: 16px">
    <li>Make sure you fulfill all requirements to pass immigration controls when reaching Colombia from your home country.</li>
    <li>Weather forecasting services have announced rains in the month of April 2018, so please bring appropriate clothes and
        an umbrella.</li>
    <li>Bogota’s altitude is 8700 feet (2650 meters), for this you could experience mild altitude sickness which would feel similar
        to flu symptoms. For this reason take easy the first 24 hours of your journey in Bogota.</li>
    <li>Check the program, which is available on the following link.
        <br>In the program you can see the hours when registration desk is open.
    </li>
    <li>Check transportation information available at this link.</li>
    <li>If you need a cab, please enquire about it in your point of departure (hotel, airport, etc.). You can also install in
        your mobile Easytaxi or Tappsi which are apps that allow you to hail a cab on the streets.
    </li>
    <li>The Universidad de Los Andes consists of many buildings spread over “El eje ambiental”. The conference venue is in the
        “Mario Laserna” building. Always enter/leave the venue using the lateral entrance of such a building, which is located
        at calle 19 A # 1 - 82 Este.</li>
    <li>The first day of your attendance, security guards will check if your name is on the CIbSE attendee list, in which case
        they will allow you to enter the building. The entrance/exit to the building will be smoothed as soon as you have
        your badge, which is in the Welcome kit that you will receive at the registration desk. Keep your badge safe.
    </li>
    <li>Colombian culture is strongly oriented towards people moving in groups. If possible, move over the city with friends!</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p align="justify">
    We look forward to meet you in Bogota.
</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">Sincerely yours,
