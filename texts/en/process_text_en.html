    Payment is available through SIRE which is the application that gives you access to events hosted at “Universidad de los Andes (Bogotá, CO)”.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Basically, the payment process consists of two steps: i) Sign up; and ii) Payment.
    You should carry out the “Sign up” step ONLY ONCE if you do not have an email account from “Universidad de los Andes”. 
    After that, you should proceed with payment.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Authors with multiple accepted papers must pay for the first article choosing the “General Public” option. 
    For the second (and third) accepted article(s), authors should make a separated payment (instead an additional 
    “Sign up” IS NOT REQUIRED) and choose the "Additional article" option. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
    If you want to pay for additional Gala Dinner tickets, then you have to make a separated payment too.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    In addition to payment, at least one of the paper's authors must come to the conference and present it. Otherwise, the paper
    will be excluded from the proceedings that are made available online by
    <u><a href="http://www.proceedings.com"><font color="0000FF">Curran Associates</font></a></u>, and later indexed by Scopus.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Please, read all the instructions given in this <u><a href="files/PPGC_CIbSE_2018_Registration.pdf"><font color="0000FF">PDF</font></a></u> (written in English) before payment. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Once the read is done, you can proceed to pay through the SIRE platform by clicking this <u><a href="https://sire.uniandes.edu.co/pagos/ "><font color="0000FF">link</font></a></u>.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    If you made a mistake in the payment step and you cancel the process, you have to wait 3 hours to start a new payment again.

                        transaction and send a confirmation email to your registered account.
                        Please, if you are an author then forward the confirmation to <u><a href='mailto:infocibse@gmail.com'><font color="0000FF">infocibse@gmail.com</font></a></u> but 
                        previously edit the email subject as follows: “[payment] article XX entitled YY”, where XX is the number assigned to your 
                        submission by EasyChair and YY is the paper title. Sending this email IS MANDATORY since it will help us to figure 
                        out the correspondence between payment and article.
