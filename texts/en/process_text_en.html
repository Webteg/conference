    Please click on this <u><a href="https://sire.uniandes.edu.co/pagos/ "><font color="0000FF">button</font></a></u> 
    to access to SIRE which is the payment application that give access to events hosted at the “Universidad de los Andes
    (Bogotá, CO)”. In addition, follow this
    <u><a href="files/PPG_CIbSE_2018_Registration.pdf"><font color="0000FF">PDF</font></a></u> 
    (written in English) that guides you through the payment process in a straightforward way. Basically, the process consists
    of two steps: i) registration; and ii) payment.

    In addition to payment, at least one of the paper's authors must come to the conference and present it. Otherwise, the paper
    will be excluded from the proceedings that are made available online by
    <u><a href="http://www.proceedings.com"><font color="0000FF">Curran Associates</font></a></u>, and later indexed by Scopus.</p>
<p align="justify">
    In case you have multiple accepted articles, you should choose either the "Full Inscription" or the "Main Conference" option
    as paying for the first accepted article. For the second (and third) accepted article(s), you should make a separated
    payment and choose the "Additional article" option. If you have an active email account from the “Universidad de los
    Andes” or you have registered on the SIRE system and paid for the first article, you have to skip the registration step
    and go right to the payment step for the second (and third) article(s).
