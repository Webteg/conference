<p align="justify">CIbSE 2018 organizes a Doctoral Symposium aimed at disseminating research-in-progress conducted by novice researchers. A board of experts will discuss with the researchers to suggest new perspectives and improvements to the PhD thesis.</p>
<p align="justify">The submitted research can address any of the CIbSE 2018 research topics. We recommend, although it is not compulsory, that the research reached an intermediate stage (~ 2º thesis year), so that experts’ suggestions could be included in the PhD work.</p>
