    <b>Abstract</b>
</h3>
<p align="justify">Forty years after requirements engineering (RE) was first acknowledged as an independent discipline, a strong and (more or
    less) self-confident research community has emerged and contributed a variety of tools, methods, and approaches. Today,
    the common view is that RE as a discipline is stable and respected. However, it’s also evident that after 40 years, conducting
    the research that industry needs is still a challenge. “Research that industry needs” means research that solves industrial
    problems practitioners face. But do we really understand those problems? </p>
<p align="justify">In this talk, I will elaborate on the current state of evidence in requirements engineering research and the emerging need
    for strong and robust theories on what works in practice and what doesn't in order to strengthen the practical relevance
    of our research outcomes. I will highlight ongoing research initiatives to overcome the lack of evidence and conclude
    with an overview of current research challenges.

    Daniel Méndez is a senior research fellow in software & systems engineering at the Technical University of Munich, Germany.
    He is further director of the junior research groups at the Centre Digitization. Bavaria, a research incubator for interdisciplinary
    topics in context of digitization. His research is on (empirical) software and systems engineering with a particular
    focus on interdisciplinary, qualitative research in Requirements Engineering and its quality improvement. He has regularly
    published in various software engineering venues ranging from IEEE RE over Information and Software Technology to the
    Empirical Software Engineering journal. He has occupied several key positions in conferences of the empirical software
    engineering. He is further a member of the ACM, the IEEE Computer Society, and the German association of university professors
    and lecturers, and he serves as the University representative to ISERN, the International Empirical Software Engineering
    Research Network.
