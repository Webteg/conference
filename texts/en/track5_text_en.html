<p> This track welcomes papers related to all aspects of artificial intelligence and their application to solving practical problems. This includes, but is not limited to, works related to knowledge representation, automatic reasoning, planning, natural language processing, agent-based systems, computer vision, computational learning, pattern matching, and automatic knowledge discovery. Practical works, where particular methods are used to solve concrete problems, are also welcomed. In those cases, the submission should include a clear presentation of the problem and the solution strategy, and a systematic and objective evaluation of the performance of the solution. </p>
