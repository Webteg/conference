<p align="justify">Daniel MÃ©ndez is a lecturer in software & systems engineering at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. He is further
    director of the junior research groups at the Centre Digitization. Bavaria, a research incubator for interdisciplinary
    topics in context of digitization. His research is on (empirical) software and systems engineering with a particular
    focus on interdisciplinary, qualitative research in Requirements Engineering and its quality improvement. He has regularly
    published in various software engineering venues ranging from IEEE RE over Information and Software Technology to the
    Empirical Software Engineering journal. He has occupied several key positions in conferences of the empirical software
    engineering. He is further a member of the ACM, the IEEE Computer Society, and the German association of university professors
    and lecturers, and he serves as the University representative to ISERN, the International Empirical Software Engineering
    Research Network.

    <b>Description</b>
</h3>
<p align="justify">
    Among observational studies, surveys allow a significant amount of generalization since they tend to sample larger populations
    than other more controlled methods such as experiments. When starting a research endeavor, especially inside a novel
    domain, it is often difficult to assess the potential relevance of specific tools, techniques, and language. Surveys
    are able to address such a need and provide a snapshot of the current state of the practice on a specific topic. As such,
    they represent a powerful asset in researcher' toolboxes. In this tutorial, we will introduce into the basics and tools
    of survey research in software engineering and discuss typical pitfalls in a hands-on manner.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    We will cover the following aspects: Introduction to survey research in context of empirical software engineering research;
    Survey methodology: a general framework to understand the specific components in the design and implementation of a survey;
    Tools and pitfalls to watch out: a general overview and exchange on typical pitfalls when running surveys especially
    with the industry.
</p>

    The presentation will mix theoretical background, examples, and discussions on cases that participant are encouraged to bring
    to the general discussion. We further plan for a short hands-on session where participants can design their own survey
    to be distributed among the audience of the conference. Anyone considering survey research in context of his work should
    attend it.
