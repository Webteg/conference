The increasing complexity in organizations has had an enormous impact on the information systems that support their operational and strategical processes. As a result, the field has seen the emergence of new approaches, methodologies, technologies, tools and languages to describe, analyze, build, and manage such increasingly complicated systems. The goal of this track is to present and discuss theoretical and practical proposals to address the aforementioned challenges.
