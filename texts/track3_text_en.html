This track is the evolution of the Workshop on Experimental Software Engineering. 
ESELAW provides a stimulating forum at which researchers and practitioners can present 
and discuss recent research results on a wide range of topics related to Experimental 
Software Engineering. In addition, the track encourages the exchange of ideas so as to 
understand the strengths and weaknesses of software engineering technologies and 
methods from a strong empirical viewpoint, including different kinds of empirical studies. 
Research on empirical methods and the design and analysis of empirical studies are also 
welcome. ESELAW is now an integral part of CIbSE as a whole.
