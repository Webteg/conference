Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is a research, formative, and practical discipline that studies the design of interactive systems. It lies at the crossroads of scientific areas such as psychology, computer vision, face recognition, and ubiquitous computing, among others. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in measuring and improving all aspects of the HCI. This track aims to promote and spread recent advances in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), both at the academic and the industrial level. It is expected this track will become a meeting point for international research groups working in HCI, as well as a source for collaboration opportunities between universities and enterprises with interests on the field.
