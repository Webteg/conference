<p> The main goal of this track is to open up a space for the discussion of software engineering topics between
academics and industry members. The discussion will be based on both academic and industrial works submitted for
evaluation. Papers are especially expected to present innovative ways for improving software quality and/or the
productivity of development teams. This includes, but is not limited to, topics such as Model Driven Engineering,
Software Architecture, Software Product Lines, and Agile Methodologies and Tools. Papers presenting practical
experiences are also welcomed. For example, case studies showing the application of particular techniques or
methodologies on industrial scenarios and discussing measured advantages and difficulties in their application. </p>
