    As we are aware, nowadays, software is ubiquitous, thus, we require more and more talented software engineers. However, we
    see less competition to join our graduation courses. We find this very bad and a difficult problem to solve.
</p>
<p align="justify">We have discussed this problem quite a lot at our Department (the Informatics Department of the Federal University of Espírito
    Santo). The main reasons we found for the exodus are:
</p>
<ul style="font-size: 16px" class="text-justify">
    <li>In general, software engineers are now well payed in our State and moving up in the career is hard. This means that if
        people want to have better jobs, they must move to the big centers, e.g. Sao Paulo or Rio de Janeiro. But they are
        aware that life in these big centers can be chaotic and expensive, so this may not be a good idea.
    </li>
    <li>Since our city is very small and the opportunities for software companies are limited, these companies know each other
        and they have the tendency to group together and discuss options to improve their profit margins. It happens sometimes
        that people that are not satisfied in their work and seek for other opportunities are reported. This is very bad!
    </li>
    <li>
        Other courses have recently gained more visibility, such as Production Engineering, Petroleum Engineering, and Mechanical
        Engineering. We feel that the best students, who were previously (around the 90s) enlisting in our courses are now
        going to these other ones. Moreover, new private universities have been inaugurated. This also creates competition.

    </li>
    <li>There is also a perception of the usual problem faced by universities around the world, regarding the lack of women in
        engineering disciplines.</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
    We have been giving a lot of emphasis in trying to solve this problem. Some of the actions we took are:
</p>
<ul style="font-size: 16px" class="text-justify">
    <li>
        Strengthening the visibility of our graduate and undergraduate courses by advertising achievements in the website, university
        press and local press.
    </li>
    <li>
        Establishing collaboration with public institutions (e.g. public high schools), so that the students can come and spend time
        at our university to learn about the courses.

    </li>
    <li>
        Taking the opportunities found to advertise the courses also in private high schools (these are very personal opportunities,
        e.g. the school of the children of the department professors).
    </li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
    We do not feel that our government (federal, state or city) gives much thought about this problem. We have not found any
    fruitful partnership there.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Regarding the companies, some of them have sought us for small projects, and a few partnerships have been established. For
    instance, when some of their employees join our graduate courses (through the usual selection process), the companies
    free some time for them to attend classes and do scientific work. A few times, (software) companies have made agreements
    with our researchers to develop applied projects of their need. But these initiatives are still shy.
