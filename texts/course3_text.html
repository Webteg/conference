    <b>Description</b>
</h3>
<p align="justify">
    Modern business is done increasingly online in a network of other businesses and consumers. Business processes are intertwined
    with information technology (IT), and the adoption of new IT such as cloud computing, sensor technology, big data technology
    and artificial intelligence is often referred to as the digital transformation. In this context, IT requirements are
    business requirements, and software engineering has become part of business engineering. In this tutorial we present
    the e3value method to identify IT requirements by creating a business model of online business.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The core discipline is business modeling, which consists of modeling the network of businesses and consumers that exchange
    objects of value with each other, such as money, goods, services, or experiences (e.g. music). Before IT requirements
    are identified, this network must be analyzed from an economic perspective on profitability for all business actors,
    as well as on robustness against online fraud.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Once the business model is shown to be economically robust and sustainable, it must be mapped to requirements on the IT infrastructure
    that will deliver the required services, and to processes that coordinate services provided by different business actors.
    This results in three mutually aligned models, namely an e3value business model, an IT architecture model, and a coordination
    process model. Changes in any one of these models may result in changes in the other two models.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The tutorial presents some illustrative as well as real-world examples of business models, and will demonstrate the free
    software with which these models can be created and analyzed.
