  CibSE (formerly IDEAS) is the leading research forum on Software Engineering in Ibero-America. The main objective of this conference is to promote high-quality scientific research in Ibero-American countries, supporting the researchers in this community in publishing and discussing their work. In addition, the conference fosters collaboration and cross-fertilization among software academics, students, and industry.

  After 20 successful editions, CibSE <?php echo $year; ?> will be held in <?php echo $menu["en"]["city"]["name"]?>, <?php echo $country; ?> on <?php echo $menu["en"]["date"]["month"]; ?> <?php echo $menu["en"]["date"]["days"]; ?>, <?php echo $year; ?>. The event will include research paper presentations, tutorials, a doctoral symposium, and keynote speeches by renowned researchers. The CIbSE community celebrates this year the 20th anniversary of the conference, happy to go forward with the event previously known as IDEAS. Fortunatelly, the conference has grown year by year, becoming a unique event for the
  Ibero-american Software Engineering community. CibSE <?php echo $year; ?> is thus an incredible opportunity for the CIbSE family and for many people who are still going to integrate it.
