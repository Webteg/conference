Technology Enhanced Learning - TEL is experiencing an historical moment of both opportunities and challenges. The ecosystem of education is changing rapidly: openness, ubiquity, co-learning, massive global learning communities are transforming learning settings, and innovation in technology is both supporting and evolving from these changes. In its 2014 report on the Ten Key Trends in ICT, the IEEE Computer Society included Education as one on the three main application fields, while personalized experiential learning was one of the leading ICT trends for the next five years according to the IBM 2013 edition of the 5 to 5 report.
