<p> The goal of this track is to create opportunities for discussion between researchers, students, practitioners, entrepreneurs, and government officials interested in computer vision and image processing. We expect submissions presenting novel and innovative works related to topics such as image processing, analysis and classification in domains such as medical and satellite imaging; image synthesis; computational geometry; and virtual and augmented reality immersive environments; and video games. We also welcome papers describing applications, prototypes, and experiences about technology integration in real contexts, especially if they have had impact at the national level. </p>
