    <b>Description</b>
</h3>
<p align="justify">
    Advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) have provided a global infrastructure of networked physical entities, able to monitor
    and control their physical status and surrounding environment, as well as to expose themselves via data streams and services
    over the network. Recently, cloud computing and the IoT are ever stronger converging, thus creating very large-scale
    distributed systems. Such IoT Cloud systems offer numerous advantages and create new opportunities to the variety of
    the involved stakeholders in terms of optimizing key tasks of their business process, enabling real-time access to previously
    unreachable parts of the production process and enabling new types of cross-domain applications. However, due to diversity,
    complexity and scale of IoT Cloud systems, elasticity requirements for the new types of resources, fine-grained consumption
    and customization of the IoT cloud infrastructure, the need to handle large volumes of IoT data in a nontrivial manner,
    such IoT Cloud systems create a plethora of challenges for system designers and operations managers to realize them in
    practice.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    In this presentation, we will mainly focus on two key challenges in engineering novel IoT Cloud systems: Programming such
    system and Provisioning the IoT/Edge infrastructure.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    <strong>Programming in IoT Cloud: </strong>To date, the development of IoT Cloud systems and applications mostly involves composing
    device-level services into complex control sequences and data processing schemes, which makes the development process
    a highly challenging task and potentially limits the programming scale of such applications on cloud platforms. Concrete
    abstractions and mechanisms, which enable efficient, more intuitive and scalable development of cloud-based IoT applications
    remain underdeveloped.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    <strong>Provisioning IoT/Edge Infrastructure: </strong>Further, the IoT infrastructure resource have been mostly provided as
    coarse grained, rigid packages, specifically tailored for the problem at hand, which do not allow for flexible customization
    and provisioning of the individual resource components or the overall deployment topologies. This inherently hinders
    self-service, utility-oriented consumption of the IoT resources at a finer granularity level.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The presentation will consist of two main parts. In the first part, we will discuss the theoretical background of to the
    key tasks in IoT Cloud systems engineering. We will especially focus on the programming and provisioning aspects of IoT
    Cloud systems engineering and discuss the recent advances (models, methodologies, frameworks etc.), highlighting our
    own work in this area. The second part of this presentation will be more practical and industry-focused. In this part,
    we will give an overview of the available (open source and commercial) technologies for engineering IoT Cloud systems
    and discuss the most relevant approaches in detail, highlighting their strengths, analyzing the potential weaknesses
    and how such technologies can complement each other to support full-stack engineering of IoT Cloud systems.
