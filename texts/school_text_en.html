	The Ibero-American School on Software Engineering (EIbAIS) represents
	the CIbSE initiative to disseminate software engineering knowledge in
	Ibero-America. It starts as a natural evolution of the CIbSE tutorials
	and short courses, by including prospective topics in the field and
	non-exclusively regarding the main CIbSE tracks: technologies,
	experimentation, and requirements. 
<br/>
<br/> The aims of EIbAIS is to promote a forum for discussions regarding software engineering and its
	related technologies and theoretical foundations, allowing the
	participation of practitioners, undergraduate and graduate students and
	researchers in the activities. 
<br/>
<br/>As in any CIbSE related activity, all lecturers are volunteers engaged with contributing to CIbSE
	community and the spreading of Software Engineering knowledge in
	Ibero-America. However, depending on the number of registrations in
	EIbAIS and the CIbSE budget, some supporting for traveling and
	conference registration should be allocated for them. 
<br/>
<br/>In its first issue, EIbAIS is going to be organized into two basic categories
	of plenary sessions for two days: state-of-the-practice and
	state-of-the-art modules. 
<br/>
<br/>The modules regarding the
	state-of-the-practice offer discussions on topics of general interest
	and usually represent local demand. These modules support the amendment
	of knowledge and practical issues to the participants, presenting
	evidence based software engineering results to the audience. Examples
	of state-of-practice topics include CASE tools, software testing of
	conventional systems, scenario based specifications, surveys,
	controlled experiments, and so on. The modules regarding the
	state-of-the art offer discussion on topics of prospective interest and
	usually represent software engineering community perspectives. These
	modules intend to provide information on ongoing and next to coming
	software engineering technologies candidates that could represent
	breakthroughs concepts in the field. Examples of state-of-the art
	topics include requirements specification for Ubiquitous systems,
	software testing of context awareness systems, software engineering for
	Internet of Things, simulation based experiments in software
	engineering, synthesis of evidence, and so on. 
<br/>
<br/>All the participants that take part in the plenary sessions will get a certificate of
	participation, indicating the modules, lecturers, and contents. 
<br/>
<br/>The main topics for both types of modules of 1<sup>st</sup> EIbAIS are
	going to be announced soon!
