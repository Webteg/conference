<h3>Call for papers</h3>

<p>		
The Colombian Computing Society (SCo2) and Universidad de los Andes invite you to submit unpublished papers with original work to the 10th edition of the Colombian Computing Congress (10CCC) that will take place in Bogotá, Colombia. Submitted works are expected to present advances in different disciplines related to computing, as well as practical works showing the application of novel techniques in real scenarios. Besides full papers, the 10CCC also welcomes poster submissions presenting works in their early stages of development.
</p>

Submissions are acceptable written in Spanish or English. Full papers should be formatted according to IEEE guidelines and they should not exceed 8 letter-size pages. LaTeX and MS Word type settings are acceptable (although LaTeX is preferred). Authors are strongly recommended to use the templates which are available at:

10CCC will follow a multi-conference format to encourage the consolidation of strong research communities in interest areas. Nine research areas/tracks with previous national publishing records have been identified. For each track, a program committee will be assembled and a specific calendar will be prepared for the conference; the main practical advantage of this format is to promote communication, both, during and after the event. The 9 selected tracks are the following:
</p>		


 <ul class="" style="list-style-type: none;">
              	<?php
              		for($i = 0; $i<9; $i++)
              		{
              			echo "<li><a href=\"" . $menu[$lang]["tracks"][$i]["url"].$suffix."\">". $menu[$lang]["tracks"][$i]["name"]."</a></li>";
					}
              	?>
</ul>

<h3>Proceedings</h3>
 
Negotiations have been made to make the post-proceedings of the conference available through IEEEXplore. Only papers presented at the conference by their authors can be published in IEEEXplore. Furthermore, the best papers from the conference will be sent to RCC and Avances en Sistemas e Informática for the publication of improved and/or extended versions.
