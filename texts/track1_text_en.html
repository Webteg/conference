  The successful and effective application of formal methods onto practical cases depends on a variety of academical, technical, and social aspects. The main of goal of this track is to foster a new space for collaboration around formal methods, centered on the presentation and discussion of applied and theoretical works in the field. We especially encourage the submission of works presenting case studies where formal methods have been developed, adopted and applied to engineering projects. This includes, but is not limited to, works related to hybrid techniques for systems' modeling and analysis (both formal and semi-formal); the integration of tools and techniques to software development projects; and the development of tools and techniques for automated and semi-automated verification applied to industrial cases. Foundational contributions are also welcomed on topics such as computational logic, theory of computation, specification, verification, refining, static and dynamic analysis, decision processes, model checking, automata, and theorem proving. Authors are invited to show how their results are applicable to the practice of engineering.
