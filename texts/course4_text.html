<p align="justify">Prof. Fabio Queda Bueno da Silva. He has a BSc degree in Computer Science from the University of Campinas (1987). He has
    a PhD in Computer Science from Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science, University of Edinburgh, Scotland (1992).
    He was a senior visiting researcher at the University of Toronto, Canada, in the area of software engineering (2011-2012).
    He is a Professor of Software Engineering at the Centre for Informatics at the Federal University of Pernambuco since
    1993. He participates as a reviewer of several international journals including IEEE Software, IEEE Transactions on Software
    Engineering, Empirical Software Engineering Journal, Information and Software Technology Journal, Journal of Systems
    and Software, and Journal of Computer Standards & Interface. He is also member of the Editorial Board of Information
    and Software Technology Journal. He was President of the Technological Institute of Pernambuco (1999-2000), Founding
    Member and CEO of Digital Port Science Park (2001-2003), founder of the Center for Advanced Studies and System at Recife
    CESAR, where he was the Finance Director (1996-1998) and President (2013-2014). He is a certified Foresight Practitioner
    by the Institute for the Future (2015). His areas of research, teaching and consulting include human factors in software,
    software projects and teams, innovation management, local and national systems of innovation, and entrepreneurship. Fabio
    Silva has being actively engage in research on empirical software engineering focusing on qualitative field studies in
    industry, mostly employing case study and ethnography methods.

    <b>Description</b>
</h3>
<p align="justify">
    The Qualitative Research paradigm focuses on understanding the meaning people attribute to a phenomenon of interest for the
    researcher. Our goal when performing qualitative study often is to discover, describe, interpret, and understand the
    phenomenon from the perspective of those being studied. We believe, as researchers engaged in qualitative research in
    software engineering context, that achieving insight and understanding from the perspective of the practitioners in their
    working context offers the greatest promises of improving software engineering practice. However, the philosophical foundations
    and, as a consequence, the methods and tools of qualitative research are very different from those of positivist, the
    quantitative paradigm that usually underlies controlled experimentation and survey research. The understanding of these
    epistemological and ontological foundations of qualitative research is important not only for the design and for development
    of the research, but to interpret and assess the validity of its results.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    In this tutorial, I will introduce the basic philosophical foundations that underlie the qualitative research paradigm and
    then, using practical examples of qualitative studies about the software engineering practice, I intend to describe the
    most common research methods and tools used to design and conduct qualitative studies.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    I will cover the following aspects: the epistemological and ontological foundations of qualitative research; the three main
    qualitative research methods and their application in software engineering research – basic qualitative research, qualitative
    case studies, and ethnography; techniques for data collection and analysis; ethical aspects; interpretation of qualitative
    studies’ results and validity issues.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The presentation will start with a brief discussion on the theoretical foundations. I will then present practical examples
    of qualitative studies of software practice. At this point, I will encourage the participants to share their research
    problems, and we will discuss in the group how to apply qualitative research methods to address these problems. Then,
    I will use a practical example to explain data collection and analysis techniques. Finally, I will stimulate a group
    discussion about interpretation of research results, application of the findings, and validity issues.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Anyone interested in conducting qualitative research is welcome to this tutorial. Nevertheless, the tutorial will also be
    of interest for those researchers seeking for a broader understanding of the philosophical foundations of different research
    paradigms and how these differences influence the design, development, and assessment of empirical studies.
