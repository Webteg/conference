<p align="justify">Doctoral Symposium papers comprehend those
	describing PhD work in progress. It should be a single author
	publication (thus, the name of the supervisor should not be included).
	Suggested paper structure:</p>
<br />
<p>
<ul style="text-ident: 20%">
	<li>Introduce the field of research and identify the main
		challenges related to it.</li>
	<li>Clearly formulate the research questions and objectives,
		justifying why they were chosen.</li>
	<li>Outline the current knowledge of the problem domain, as well
		as the state of existing solutions.</li>
	<li>Sketch the research methodology that is being applied.</li>
	<li>Introduce the proposed solution and the results achieved so
		far.</li>
	<li>State in what aspects the suggested solution is different or
		better as compared to existing approaches.</li>
	<li>Indicate the outstanding issues and describe the next steps
		that are planned.</li>
	<li>Provide a list of references</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p align="justify">All papers must fall under the topics
	mentioned for the Foundations tracks (i.e., SET, WER, ESELAW). In
	addition, they must be submitted through the EasyChair submission system,
	using PDF format only. Submissions must be written in English,
	Portuguese, or Spanish. Moreover, the paper should not exceed 8 pages,
	and it should be formatted according to the LNCS style. At least one
	author of accepted DS papers must register by the camera-ready
	deadline. One registration corresponds to only one paper.</p>
<p>We plan to have three DS sessions, one for each of the
	conferenceâ€™s tracks, and the reviewers should be chosen accordingly.</p>
