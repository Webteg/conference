<p> The main goal of this track is to create a space for the presentation of works and for fostering the discussion between researchers, students, academics and practitioners, in fields related to information and knowledge. The evolution of information requirements in diverse domains (big volumes of data, non-structured data, persistence in big-scale repositories, as well as in mobile devices) has resulted in renewed challenges for data storage, representation, query and analysis. As an added challenge, there is the question of how to use all those new technologies in an effective fashion for turning raw data into information and knowledge. For this, it is also important to study and innovate in the design of methodologies and practices for the management and government of said information.

<p> This track welcomes academic works presenting innovations and contributions to the state of the art, as well as more practical works discussing the application of innovative technologies to specific domains, or reporting and analyzing experiences in industrial / organizational scenarios.
